#Garden Management App

This app is being built to manage a hydroponic garden.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the garden front repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone garden_front

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
https://github.com/igiagante/garden_front/
cd garden_front
```

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

```
npm update
npm install
bower install
```
Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

### Run the Application

The simplest way to run this app is:

```
gulp serve
```
Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000/#/plants`.
